# Docking Test Player 4

## Step 1
To complete the docking sequence each ring needs to be rotated to point to a specific shape. Each team member should only set a single ring. Your team communicator will tell you which ring you should control and when you should set it. 

Wait for your team communicator to tell you when to run your code. Running your code too early or too late will fail the test.
