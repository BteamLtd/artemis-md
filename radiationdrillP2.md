# Radiation Drill Player 2

## Step 1
Each player will have their own individual tasks. As player 2, you will need to complete step 3 which is to cover the shelter using the ``||artemis: cover shelter||`` block. Don't run your code until your team communicator tells you to.

```ghost
    artemis.clearShelterA3P2()
    artemis.surroundShelterA3P3()
    artemis.coverShelterA3P4()
```
```template
//
```

```package
artemis-ts=github:ReWrite-Media/artemis-ts#v0.0.66
