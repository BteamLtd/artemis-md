# Docking Test Player 2

## Step 1
To complete the docking sequence each ring needs to be rotated to the correct setting by using the ``||artemis.rotate||`` block. Each team member should only set a single ring. Your team communicator will tell you which ring you should control and what color it should be set to. Wait for your team communicator to tell you when to run your code. Running your code too early or too late will fail the test.
