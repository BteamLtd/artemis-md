# Docking Test Player 1

## Step 1
You're the communicator! To fully engage the docking latch, all 3 rings need to be turned to the correct setting. Each team member should only control a single ring. Your job is to assign each of them a ring and tell them what color it should be set to. This needs to be done in the following order:

~~Step 1: Inner ring should be set to green~~  
~~Step 2: Middle ring should be set to blue~~  
Step 3: Outer ring should be set to red
