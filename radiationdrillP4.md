# Radiation Drill Player 4

## Step 1
Each player will have their own individual tasks. As player 4, you will need to complete step 1 which is to clear the shelter area of cargo using the ``||artemis: clear cargo||`` block. Don't run your code until your team communicator tells you to.

```ghost
    artemis.clearShelterA3P2()
    artemis.surroundShelterA3P3()
    artemis.coverShelterA3P4()
```
```template
//
```

```package
artemis-ts=github:ReWrite-Media/artemis-ts#v0.0.66
