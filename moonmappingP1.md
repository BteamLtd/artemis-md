# Moon Mapping

## Step 1
The first thing we'll need to do is mark the three locations we want to investigate. Use the grid on your screen to find three locations with ice you want to explore, and then use the ``||artemis.set location||`` block to mark the locations.

```ghost
    artemis.setLocationA8P1()
```
```template
    //
```

```package
artemis-ts=github:ReWrite-Media/artemis-ts#v0.0.54
```
